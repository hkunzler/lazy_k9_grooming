                        Your pet may be super excited to meet us! Or, your pet
                        may be a little nervous. It’s normal for dogs to be
                        nervous sometimes when their owners leave them. While
                        many dogs love their spa days and are happy to get
                        straight to it, some dogs view the groomer more like we
                        humans view the dentist or how a human child views being
                        left with a babysitter. Almost all dogs relax and are
                        happy to hang out once their owners have left their
                        sight. We will always communicate openly and honestly
                        about your dog’s experience and behavior.

                        What do I need to do before my dog is groomed for the
                        first time?

                        We require a current rabies vaccine to be groomed at
                        Lazy K9 and strongly suggest that your pet is fully
                        vaccinated according to your vet’s recommendation. Your
                        pup should be free of pests (fleas, lice, intestinal
                        parasites, etc) before coming into the salon. While we
                        live in tick country, a small number of ticks may be
                        removed free of charge, but infestations will incur an
                        extra charge.

                        Do you use kennels at your salon?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        While we use a few stand-alone wire kennels for dogs
                        that require them, most dogs are kept in separated pens.
                        Social dogs may roam with the trusted shop dogs after
                        supervised introductions, but we do not have dogs from
                        separate families socializing together. This practice
                        helps reduce kennel anxiety, noise, and messes.

                        All breeds are welcome at Lazy K9, including doodles,
                        bully breeds, and giant breeds. Some breeds and mixes
                        may require a strict grooming schedule to ensure the
                        physical well-being of our staff and the longevity of
                        their careers.

                        Do you groom aggressive dogs?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Aggression in dogs can be complex, stemming from fear,
                        trauma, or genetics. While we don’t turn dogs away for
                        behavior, dogs that are adverse to grooming may need to
                        go through "grooming rehab" with many short, easy
                        appointments to desensitize them. Safety is paramount,
                        and we reserve the right to refuse service if a dog's
                        behavior is too risky.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Health and comfort are our priorities. Dogs with severe
                        matting or tangles may need to be shaved. We aim to meet
                        your expectations accurately and encourage you to bring
                        pictures to illustrate your desired style.

                        Appointment duration varies based on your pet's on-time
                        arrival, mood, and style needs. We don't rush, as haste
                        can stress pets. If you have a specific pickup time,

                    <p>
                        For safety and efficacy, we request that owners not stay
                        during grooming. This helps keep pets calm and allows
                        groomers to build trust with them. Please return only
                        once we contact you.

                        Regular grooming is crucial; we suggest a maximum of 8
                        weeks between appointments. The frequency can vary based
                        on the dog’s lifestyle, coat type, and home maintenance.

                        Yes, creative grooming is safe. We use dyes specially
                        formulated for the pH of canine skin to express your

                    <p>
                        Ear plucking and anal gland expression are done at the
                        discretion of the groomer and may be referred to a vet.
                        Regular maintenance can be crucial but must be handled
                        carefully to avoid complications.
